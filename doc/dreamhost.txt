dreamhost.com setup
===================

On a shared dreamhost.com account, some minor things need to be done to 
get it working 'just right'.
  
1. Checkout CalMon from git:

    $ git clone <blah> <host>

2. install all the Local gems you need:

    $ gem install bundler
    $ cd <host>
    $ bundle install

3. Ensure that 'passenger/ruby' is enabled for the host
4. Note that config.ru in the git root is the script run by passenger that
   spools up RACK and all that.
5. Checkout CalMon into the hostname folder for the domain you wish to host from
6. Setup the following line in your crontab:

    */8 * * * * curl -m 1 http://HOSTNAME/ < /home/USERNAME/cron_http > /dev/null 2>&1

7. put the following into ~/cron_http:

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    User-Agent: nc
    Host: calmon.dreamhosters.com
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-length: 0
    Connection: keep-alive
    Cache-Control: max-age=0

8. create the following directories in the host folder: log, public, tmp
9. touch the restart.txt file to get Passenger to wake up the first time, and after 
   every config change:

    $ touch <host>/tmp/restart.txt

10. Enjoy :)

Note: HOSTNAME/<host> refers to the virtual domain you set up in Dreamhost.  For
example: calmon.dreamhosters.com
